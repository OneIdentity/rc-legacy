Requirements
------------
To use the module, you will need VAS 3.0 client libraries or later.

To compile the source code you will need
    VAS SDK (vasdev)
    PHP SDK (php-devel or php-dev)
    a C compiler and related toolchain
    make

For development, you will also need
    autotools (i.e. autoconf, automake)
    doxygen
    

Installing into a web server
----------------------------

If your platform does not come with a standard installation of PHP,
please run the vas-php-setup script.

    
Building
--------
If your distribution contains the file 'configure', then simply run

    configure
    make
    make check
    make package

If you have checked out the sources from subversion, then generate the
configure script by first running

    sh bootstrap.sh


Debugging notes
---------------

* Seg faults usually caused by symbol collisions with other modules.

* Add this line to the PHP script so that errors are logged:
      error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE | E_NOTICE);


Known issues
------------

* All of the vas.h API's are supported although they are not completely tested.

* Of the vas_gss.h API's, only vas_gss_initialize, vas_gss_acquire_cred, 
  vas_gss_auth are implemented.

* None of the krb5 or ldap api's are implemented yet.  
  Implementing these is pretty easy, just not done yet.

* The vas libraries are not thread safe. Locking needs to be put in place 
  to accommodate that.

* A test suite needs to be brought online.

* The high level API needs more work.  
  Need to write a couple of sample applications to see if it makes sense.
