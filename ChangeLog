4-21-06: Moving to a configure/make/make dist setup. 

5-25-06: Quite a few changes. 
Fixed a Solaris seg-fault when debug level was 3 or higher.
Now a sys-auth.conf in the users homedir takes precedence.
The plug-in will read its logging level every minute for changes.

5-30-06: Not sure where I lost the changes at, but put back in some fixes. 
When accessed in client auth mode from an AD machine, the username
included @<short domain> which wasn't recognized by the system. Fixed.

When accessed cross-instance (not sure how, somehow tables are linked),
certain things are bypassed, and a get groups happens on the upper
cased name, which would fail. Explicitly lower that name.

5-30-06: Made all internal functions name-safe. Seen where if the authentication
through db2sysc, there is possible a name collision against an internal 
DB2 function checkUser, that doesn't return what the plugin is expecting, 
making users appear to have failed when they shouldn't.  


06-05-06: Moving to a versioning of the library, tracked in the syslog output. 
Now changelog will work off the version.

1.0.0:
* Remove the func_start() from PluginTerminate, as the instance is not always valid
  when called.
* Log the version number.
* More debugging around the check_user function.

1.0.1: 
* Move the check_user function inside the CheckPassword Function.
* Name-safe ALL functions, even those derived from the example code this came from so long ago. 
* Now on AIX a combination of getgrset and getgrent is returned for group memberships. This 
  allows a combination of VAS and local groups to be used for VAS users. 
* Add more testing, this time for Groups. Modify test.conf with a group the user is a member of,
  and a group he is not a member of.   
* Added test for the sys-auth executable before running, fixes pipe errors during the tests in
  an incomplete enviroment.
* Better handling of authentication when DB2INSTANCE is not set, as during testing.   

1.0.2 (06-25-06):
* Add an explicit getuserattr from VAS for user information, this allows users who stradle both VAS
  and another system, like LDAP, to get complete group info. AIX only. 
* Added a check for the group name so only unique ones are returned. This will add a little overhead to
  authentications, should not be noticable unless a user is in multiple systems and has many group 
  overlaps, at which point it might add a few seconds to just the auth, as DB2 will store the group 
  membership info for the duration of the connection. AIX only.

1.0.3 (07-14-06):
* Add a memory check to some function calls. 
* Only lower the username during the check_password function if the original name wasn't found. 
* Remove the use of the DB2DEFAULTUSER env variable. This was a carry-over from the base code
  sample used, only UID should be considered for determining who the user is. If the user
  is to be different from the current user, then change the processes effective UID. 
* Use the effective UID when in the db2secGetDefaultLoginContext function instead of the 
  normal UID ( geteuid() vs. getuid() ).

1.0.4 (07-14-06):
* Thanks to IBM support, re-wrote the get?uid() to trigger off the useridType field.

1.0.5 (07-17-06):
* Revert old behavior of assuming ENOENT for errno == 0 when getpwnam fails. 
  This is likely from pthreads putting errno in a differnt namespace, so the 
  errno the plugin reads isn't the one set, making it return UNKNOWNERROR
  instead of BADUSER. The UNKNOWNERROR makes quite a few things complain. 

1.0.6 (07-18-06):
* Added an upgrade.sh script that can be run by the instance owner
  to replace the libraries. 
* Added the function char *vas_db2_plugin_get_version() to the
  sys-auth library, modified it to build with the version number, 
  install/upgrade now use it, and added tests for the version.
* Changed the memory test size to 11K, to put it at an odd allocation
  to differentiate it from other allocs.

1.0.7 (10-25-06):
* Some fixes for minor issues found in code review. 
* Added a Troubleshooting document.
* Added some specific debugging for a Stored Procedure issue.

1.0.8 (10-26-06):
* Refactor groups_for_user function to need no additional getpwnam calls, 
  instead storing the users pgid from the user_check to test group 
  membership with.
* Found the cause of the issue mentioned in 1.0.7. The SP had a grant 
  on a non-existent user, and the code was returning the wrong error
  code. Due to losing errno between functions, returned UNKNOWN_ERROR
  instead of BAD_USER. Fixed.

1.0.9 (11-1-06):
* Add an explicite lower to the check_user function. This fixes 
  grants on non-VAS users, as they come through upper-cased, 
  making the getpwnam not match. 

1.0.10 (11-21-06):
* Add 64-bit linux.     

1.0.11 (12-1-06):
* Added s390x Linux ( zSeries OS )
     
1.0.12 (12-11-06):
* Fixed s390x Linux. For unknown reason gcc wasn't setting __64BIT__ macro, 
  so some structure member sizes were off, leading to DB2 rejecting the plugin.  

1.0.13 ( 1-23-07):
* Added HP Itanium builds. Seperated into HPUX_9000 and HPUX_IA64 packages.    
* Better named the various packages.
* Made sure all OSes get __64BIT__ set if 64-bit, that macro is only guaranteed on AIX
  it seems.
