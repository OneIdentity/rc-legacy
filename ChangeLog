4-21-06: Moving to a configure/make/make dist setup. 

5-25-06: Quite a few changes. 
            Fixed a Solaris seg-fault when debug level was 3 or higher.
            Now a sys-auth.conf in the users homedir takes precedence.
            The plug-in will read its logging level every minute for changes.

5-30-06: Not sure where I lost the changes at, but put back in some fixes. 
            When accessed in client auth mode from an AD machine, the username
            included @<short domain> which wasn't recognized by the system. Fixed.

            When accessed cross-instance (not sure how, somehow tables are linked),
            certain things are bypassed, and a get groups happens on the upper
            cased name, which would fail. Explicitly lower that name.
           
5-30-06: Made all internal functions name-safe. Seen where if the authentication
         through db2sysc, there is possible a name collision against an internal 
         DB2 function checkUser, that doesn't return what the plugin is expecting, 
         making users appear to have failed when they shouldn't.  


06-05-06: Moving to a versioning of the library, tracked in the syslog output. 
          Now changelog will work off the version.

1.0.0:
* Remove the func_start() from PluginTerminate, as the instance is not always valid
  when called.
* Log the version number.
* More debugging around the check_user function.

1.0.1: 
* Move the check_user function inside the CheckPassword Function.
* Name-safe ALL functions, even those derived from the example code this came from so long ago. 
* Now on AIX a combination of getgrset and getgrent is returned for group memberships. This 
  allows a combination of VAS and local groups to be used for VAS users. 
* Add more testing, this time for Groups. Modify test.conf with a group the user is a member of,
  and a group he is not a member of.   
* Added test for the sys-auth executable before running, fixes pipe errors during the tests in
  an incomplete enviroment.
* Better handling of authentication when DB2INSTANCE is not set, as during testing.   

1.0.2 (06-25-06):
* Add an explicit getuserattr from VAS for user information, this allows users who stradle both VAS
  and another system, like LDAP, to get complete group info. AIX only. 
* Added a check for the group name so only unique ones are returned. This will add a little overhead to
  authentications, should not be noticable unless a user is in multiple systems and has many group 
  overlaps, at which point it might add a few seconds to just the auth, as DB2 will store the group 
  membership info for the duration of the connection. AIX only.
