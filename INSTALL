Setup example (requires root, assumes correct package for OS is in /tmp):
    cd /tmp
    gzip -c -d DB2_sys-auth_<OS>.3.0.0.<version>.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
    cd DB2_sys-auth
    ./install.sh db2inst1
    su  - db2inst1
    db2stop
    db2 update dbm cfg using SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2 update dbm cfg using GROUP_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2 update dbm cfg using CLNT_PW_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2start

    NOTE: This assumes the default instance owner/das user names of db2inst1/dasusr1,
          change as needed for the actual instance owner/das user names. 


Making:
    As the instance owner, download and untar/gzip the src package, then run:
        ./configure
        make

    Note: This will require the DB2 SDK installed.


Testing:

OS NOTES:
    AIX 5.3:
        If using PAM ( ./install.sh <instance owner> PAM )
        make sure that pam.conf is set up as per KB 28653:
        https://support.quest.com/SUPPORT/index?page=solution&id=SOL28653
        ( The other three pam sections need the same OTHER modification )
        Alternatively, a clean pam.conf can be obtained from:
        ftp://ftp.vintela.com/vas/support/aix53.pam.conf.gz
        NOTE: This pam.conf has no VAS entries, '/opt/quest/bin/vastool configure pam' 
              will need to be run after this pam.conf is put in place for VAS to
              continue to work.

    AIX 5.1/5.2:
        These OSes do not provide pam.conf, a sample aix.pam.conf is in this package.

    AIX 5.1:
        The pam_aix libraries will need to be installed to use PAM on this OS.


Known issues:
    The most common issue is pam configuration. The Quest System Auth plugin 
    uses the PAM service name sys-auth. That should be configured, or have a
    OTHER/other setup that works. If after installation of the plugin VAS users
    fail to auth, this is likely the issue. Quest Support can assist with
    getting PAM set up correctly if needed.
