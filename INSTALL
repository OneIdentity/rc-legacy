Simple setup:
For this example:
	On AIX
        instance owner name: db2inst1
        instance location: /home/db2inst1/sqllib
        Package is in /tmp
        You are installing the 64bit LAM library
	You understand the setuid'ing of the auth file.

As root:
cd /tmp
gzip -c -d DB2_AIX_bin.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
cd DB2_sys-auth/DB2_AIX_bin
./install.sh 64 LAM /home/db2inst1
(This copies the files, and does a setuid on lamAuth64 so authentication can work.)
su db2inst1
./d2conf.sh sys-auth64.so
(This sets the plug-in for SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN GROUP_PLUGIN and CLNT_PW_PLUGIN to the library, sys-auth64)


The scripts assume that the instance is avalaible from ${HOME} when running as the instance owner.

You must pick the right level for the instance, 32 or 64. That information can be received from db2level.

If you are on AIX 5.1, and want to use PAM, you will need to install the AIX PAM libraries, namely pam_aix.

Both AIX 5.1 and 5.2 do not provide pam.conf, a sample pam.conf.sample is in this package.

AIX pam_aix is 32-bit only.

The files in debug/ have '#define SHOW_ERROR 1', so they will log to /tmp/sys-auth.log. Not recommended for production due to extra disk usage, and information is logged, like passwords.
