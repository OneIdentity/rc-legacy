Simple setup:
For this example:
	On AIX 5.1 or 5.2
        instance owner name: db2inst1
        DAS user name: dasusr1
        Package is in /tmp
        You are installing the LAM library
	You understand the setuid'ing of the auth file.

As root:
    cd /tmp
    gzip -c -d DB2_AIX_51-52.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
    cd DB2_sys-auth
    ./install.sh db2inst1 LAM
    ./install_das.sh dasusr1 LAM
    (This copies the files, and does a setuid on lamAuth64 so authentication can work.)
    su  - db2inst1
    db2stop
    db2 update dbm cfg using SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2 update dbm cfg using GROUP_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2 update dbm cfg using CLNT_PW_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2start


Making:
    As the instance owner, download and untar/gzip the src package. 
    Run:
        ./configure
        make
    Note: This will require the DB2 SDK installed.     

Testing:
    Read TESTING.

If you are on AIX 5.1, and want to use PAM, you will need to install the AIX PAM libraries, namely pam_aix.

Both AIX 5.1 and 5.2 do not provide pam.conf, a sample aix.pam.conf is in this package.

Not all systems include the 64-bit PAM libraries, in that case its usually easier to just use LAM authentication.

More about this in README.
