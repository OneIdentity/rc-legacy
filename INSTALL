Simple setup:
For this example:
	On AIX
        instance owner name: db2inst1
        Package is in /tmp
        You are installing the LAM library
	You understand the setuid'ing of the auth file.

As root:
    cd /tmp
    gzip -c -d DB2_AIX_bin.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
    cd DB2_sys-auth
    ./install.sh db2inst1 LAM
    (This copies the files, and does a setuid on lamAuth64 so authentication can work.)
    su  - db2inst1
    db2stop
    db2 update dbm cfg using SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2 update dbm cfg using GROUP_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2 update dbm cfg using CLNT_PW_PLUGIN sys-auth
    db2start


Making:
    As the instance owner, download and untar/gzip the src package. 
    ./configure
    make

Testing:
    I am still working on the test framework, at the moment its pretty basic. 
    And have the sys-auth32.so library in the same directory. 
    If DB2INSTANCE is not set, or it does not have pamAuth32, the test will look for pamAuth32 in the current directory. 

If you are on AIX 5.1, and want to use PAM, you will need to install the AIX PAM libraries, namely pam_aix.

Both AIX 5.1 and 5.2 do not provide pam.conf, a sample aix.pam.conf is in this package.

AIX pam_aix is 32-bit only, meaning if you are running a 64-bit instance, do not use PAM if you need to authenticate local users.
