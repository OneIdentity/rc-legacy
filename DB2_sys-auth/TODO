A list of things I know this needs, but no time to jsut do it. 

Please let me know through Quest Support or the RC forums if any of these are needed. 

1) Fix upgrade script for s390x ( no 32-bit directory ).
2) Handle better the different DAS locations. ( 8.2 vs 9.1? )
   ( I know someone has run across this, don't have the systems to track down all the possibilities, need to know what I would be fixing ).  
3) On AIX ( LAM ), support loginsuccess/loginfailed. I think they are cool, but dont' have time to just do them, but if desired, I can see about it.   






1) Add GetAuthID test for trimming @domain
2) New binary, takes two options, 1-5 for type, getuid, geteuid, getpwnam, getgrnam, get groups, and value. 
   Returns string with needed information.
   whoAmI returns a name string. 
   DoesGRoupExist is a bool
   DoesAuthIDExist is a bool
   GetGroupsForUser is the string where the first byte is the length, \0 terminated. 
     Return with the first TWO bytes with total length? ( Since its 1024 limited ). 


   0 Success ( Found, whatever )
   2 Not found
   3+ Bad error


Member of many many groups?    

Check handles no memory for malloc of groups call.

Test for fork issue? 

Case during auth commands. ( Since its not pre-lowering any more ). 

Write uninstall instructions or script.
