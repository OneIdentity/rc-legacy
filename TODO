A list of things I know this needs for the move to fully supported:

1) Fix upgrade script for s390x ( no 32-bit directory ).
2) Make sure the failover auth for non-DB2 testing works on AIX for LAM, so the machien doesn't need PAM setup to function. 
-3) Move to single sys-auth binaries ( no 32/64 ) so PAM configuration is more striaght forward. 
-4) DAS support
-5) password change. 
6) Wells Fargo bug ( 471 maybe? )
7) Simplify the install scripts. 
8) Handle better the different DAS locations. ( 8.2 vs 9.1? )
9) Documentation updated. ( remove 8.1 reference ? alread done? )
10) Fill out testing if at all possible. Always, password change users, and a couple straight forwoard steps that mimic the auth.
11) MAke the build/test script threaded. ( regular script instead of exceed maybe? ). 
12) AD user expired can't change password, failure from pam_Authenticate....
13) Update testing with local/ad users that HAVE to change their password. And AD user that cna't change their password. ( but tries to )
14) Seperate users for the testing maybe? Definitely yes.
