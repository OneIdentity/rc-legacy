A list of things I know this needs for the move to fully supported:

1) Re-org the test framework to be by library ( server, client, and group )
2) Expand the test caces to be first functionally complete, then procedurally complete ( whoami, auth, getgroups cycle ).
3) Make sure the failover auth for non-DB2 testing works on AIX for LAM, so the machien doesn't need PAM setup to function. 
4) Once 2 is done, look for more fringe/edge cases to be tested. 
5) Fix upgrade script for s390x ( no 32-bit directory ).

For #2, here is a list of missed functionality/new cases to work on:
A) Add bad DoesGroupExist test.
B) Test both REAL and EFFECTIVE flags for GetDefaultLogonContext.
C) Test GetAuthIDs.
D) Add bad DoesAuthIDExist test.
E) Make sure there is a test for groupsForUser when the case of the username is wrong. 

So, that means out of 20 functions, only 2 are not currently tested. so 90% code coverage so far. 

Of those, one is a real simple getuid/geteuid, then return name function, the other just plugs the given value into other fields.
( If this supported domain, which is doesn't, as DB2 uses NETBIOS domain names, and VAS picks up the names jstu fine without, 
  then this last function might have needed to be more complicated ). 

Then adding two more tests, so each test checks at least a basic does it work when its good info, and 
a does it fail correctly when its bad info, and for those that apply, when its 'different' ( usually case-related issues) info. 

Once all this is done, should be 100% complete, born by the lack of any real issues since 1.0.9 ( just porting work now it seems, 
 there might be a Solaris sparc 64-bit issue, will know tomorrow I think whats going on there ). 

And I get to work on DB2 UDB v9.1 this week as well, we shall see if this stuff just works, or if something changed and need a new plugin.
