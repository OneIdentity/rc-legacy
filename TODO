A list of things I know this needs, but no time to jsut do it. 

Please let me know through Quest Support or the RC forums if any of these are needed. 

1) Fix upgrade script for s390x ( no 32-bit directory ).
2) Handle better the different DAS locations. ( 8.2 vs 9.1? )
   ( I know someone has run across this, don't have the systems to track down all the possibilities, need to know what I would be fixing ).
