A list of things I know this needs for the move to fully supported:

1) Re-org the test framework to be by library ( server, client, and group )
2) Expand the test caces to be first functionally complete, then procedurally complete ( whoami, auth, getgroups cycle ).
3) configure.in to handle s390 better for testing ( its 64-bit ONLY, 31 bit needs to be skipped on this platform ONLY ).
4) Make sure the failover auth for non-DB2 testing works on AIX for LAM, so the machien doesn't need PAM setup to function. 
5) Once 2 is done, look for more fringe/edge cases to be tested.
