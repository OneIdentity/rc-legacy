Troubleshooting the VAS DB2 Plugin.

If login/groups is failing, for either local users once the plug-in is installed, or VAS users, do the following:

Set up debug for the plugin:
The plugin reads the file sys-auth.conf from the instance owner's home directory first, and if that doesn't exist, /etc/sys-auth.conf.
The setting is 'debug-level = X', with X being a number of 0 to 4. 
Values:
0/1: No debug. 
2+:  All debug. 

( This is because of a change in the system, I didn't want someone who set it to 1 ( default previously ) to now get ALL debug. )

If there is no value, or no file,  will be treated as a 0. 

To set the debug level for an instance owned by db2inst1 to 3:
echo "debug-level = 3" >> ~db2inst1/sys-auth.conf
( The parser will use the first matching line )

This value should be read by the plug-in on a one-minute tick, so restarting the instance is not required to change the debug level. 

At this point, the plug-in should be logging DB activity. This can be verified by tailing the log file.
tail -f /tmp/sys-auth.debug
( When someone accesses the database in a way that involves the plugin, it should be logged here ) 

That file is generated directly by the plugin, syslog is no longer used.     

Once verified it is logging, go through the steps to demonstrate the issue being investigated. 
Make sure to mark the exact time of the failure. If the DB instance is busy, this will help make sure the right section of the log is examined. 

Copy off the log file at that point, and send it into Quest Support with:
1) Version of the plugin ( should be in the logs, or this output: ls -laR ~<instance owner>/sqllib/security64/plugin )
2) Explain the steps used to reproduce the issue.
3) The parts being used, like any 3rd party applications involved. 
4) DB2 version and level ( mainly, db2level output ). 
5) The user/group involved with the issue.
6) Time the issue occured.
7) Any other facts relevent to the issue.
