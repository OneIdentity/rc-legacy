[pcsc]

# The 'library' field represents the pah to the PC/SC library.
#
# This field is REQUIRED.
# 
# Replace "some-pcsc-library.so" with the path to the PC/SC library.
library=some-pcsc-library.so

# The 'reader' field represents the name of the reader to be recognized.
#
# Sometimes it is necessary to restrict insertion/removal to a specific
# reader. For example, if there are multiple readers attached to a PC, then
# it may be necessary to only recognize events on the reader actually used
# for login. 
#
# The reader is specified by its name. The name may be found by examining 
# the output of the pcscd daemon. For example:
#
#   "Axalto USB v3 reader (21120551407653) 00 00"
#
# Name matching is case-sensitive. 
# 
# This field is OPTIONAL. If it is not specified, then events on any reader
# shall be recognized.
#
# Uncomment the following line and add a valid reader name if only events on 
# the specified reader should be recognized.
#
# reader=
