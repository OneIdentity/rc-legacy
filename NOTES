Random notes from this project. 

DB2 takes three different sections. Client, Server, and Group. 

They can be three seperate libraries, or all in one library. 
Using the latter.

I had tried sym-linking the libraries in the three subdirectories to one, that filed, might have been a reletive path issue, not sure, never gone back to that method. 

DB2 loads the PluginInit function for the section it is looking for, and uses that to determine to use the plugin or not. 

Usually a db2stop is sufficent, but sometimes a db2 terminate needs to be run when uninstalling ( just setting the settings back to NULL, then stop/start might not clear it ).
