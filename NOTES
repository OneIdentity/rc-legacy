Random notes from this project. 

DB2 takes three different sections. Client, Server, and Group. 

They can be three seperate libraries, or all in one library. 
Using the latter.

I had tried sym-linking the libraries in the three subdirectories to one, that filed, might have been a reletive path issue, not sure, never gone back to that method. 

DB2 loads the PluginInit function for the section it is looking for, and uses that to determine to use the plugin or not. 

Usually a db2stop is sufficent, but sometimes a db2 terminate needs to be run when uninstalling ( just setting the settings back to NULL, then stop/start might not clear it ). 

Int size is very important. on s390x gcc isn't setting __64BIT__, so a long was used for db2int32, so a struct with two db2int32s
at the beginning pushed off all the funciton pointers after. This isnt' the flag to use for s390, if I find the right one I'll update with that. 

On s390x, the test has to be done 64-bit, seems we are missing a TON of 32 ( 31 ) bit stuff. DB2 is 64-bit only anyways on that platform.

We don't build on IA, not sure we need to. Not sure anyone is even using DB2 on HP. At least noone has asked/complained about that lack. Except now they have, so back in it goes. 

There were build issues, dealt with I think HP bugs, where when using the ssh remote the way I di, it fails, yet when doign it manually it works. I think it ran out of memory in the psuedo shell that is called. Maybe wrap the make in a bash -c "cmds" ?. Oh well, to think about when someone asks. 
It seems AIX is the only platform guaranteed to set __64BIT__, so manually set that on the others to make sure we don't have another s390x type issue. 

DB2 loads the section_init function, that returns a struct with funciton pointers to what it really uses.
