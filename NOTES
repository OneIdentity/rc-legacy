Building
========

Build instructions
  0. Ensure check out of VAS SDK from ISO or down-load. From this, you get the
        headers vas.h, vas_gss.h and vas_ldap.h (from /opt/quest/include) and
        their dependencies required to build the PHP sources.
  1. ./bootstrap.sh
  2. ./configure
  3. make
  4. make install (don't know if this works yet, so put the resulting shared
  object in the usual place or places to test)


Debugging
=========

* Seg faults usually caused by symbol collisions with other modules.

* Add this line to the PHP script so that errors are logged:
      error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE | E_NOTICE);
